2. When you click that button, it should post to the backend and update the number of "pizzas" that turtle has. Turtles should start at 0 pizzas.
3. You should also update the frontend to display the new number of pizzas that turtle has, when you click the button.
4. This button requires the user to be logged in.

1. Add a button which allows you to delete a turtle. Don't worry, they are just released into the wild, where they can eat all the pizza they want.

Optional: Allow the user to inclue a URL to a picture of the turtle, and display that image in the template. Hint: turtleTemplate.find('img').attr('src', results[i].image);
